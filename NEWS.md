# orderlabel 0.4.2
## New feautres
* `order_label` - new error messages added, documentation updated
## Bug fixes
* `order_label` - fixed bugs with rev_label in ungrouped data
## Tests
* `order_label` - Test suite redone to match tidy testing best practices: tests written by use case and not by private function performance. Expanded tests beyond current coverage


# orderlabel 0.4.1
## Bug fixes
* `order_label` - fixed a few bugs around rev_group not always working with other arguments


# orderlabel 0.4.0
## Breaking changes
* `order_same` - the *group_var* argument now takes variables outside of quotes instead of inside quotes. Done this way to match formatting of order_label and other tidy functions.
## New features
* `order_label` - new argument *percent_all* DEFAULT = FALSE; When FALSE, will put a % next to only the first number label on the chart (this is how order_label has always previously functioned). If set to TRUE, will put %s next to all numbers labels.
* `other_rm` - new argument *var*. Previously other_rm always removed parenthetical text only on the variables of 'label,' 'variable,' and 'group_var.' Now you can specify an additional variable with with the *var* argument. 
## Bug fixes
* `order_same` - fixed problems with *group_var* argument sometimes not working as expected
* `other_rm` and `preamble_rm` - More robust in removing edge cases with extra types of white space 


# orderlabel 0.3.4
## New features 
* `add_ages()` - New argument: *survey_date_var* A date variable in the dataset that specifies when the survey was taken. If specified, ages will be calculated off this and not the year_of_survey argument. Especially helpful for trended data that spans multiple years. For example, this argument would calculate that someone born in 2000 taking a survey in 2020 was only 20 when they took the survey. However, if the same respondent took another wave of the survey in 2021, they would now be calculated as 21 years old in the new round but still 20 years old for the previous round.


# orderlabel 0.3.3
## New features 
* `add_ages()` - New argument: "year_of_survey". DEFAULT = Whatever the current year is. Used to calculate respondent ages. If you are using old survey data from a previous year, you can input the year here as a numeric value (e.g. 1994)


# orderlabel 0.3.1
## Improvements
*`add_ages()` - census_age_groups now an ordered factor variable instead of a character variable. Function also now creates "census_age_groups_6" (same as original census_age_groups, but with the 18-34 group split into 18-24 & 25-34)
## Bugs
*`order_label()` - Problem fixed where order_label() would sometimes break when freqs was grouped by user-created variables


# orderlabel 0.3.0
## Possible breaking changes
*`order_label()` - TLDR: Order of rows in output now arranged by factor level, so order_label now works with updated versions of htmltools and mschart. Details are...
*This update fixes the ordering problems introduced in htmltools versions > 3.6.0 and mschart versions > 2.5.0. To do this, the frequency output from order_label may look slightly different in some cases. The label/group_var are still factored in the same order as before, but the physical arrangement is different in some cases. Because mschart now pulls from the "physical order" the tables are arranged in, and not the "factor order", the frequency table will look different in some cases to match mschart, but the charts will all be ordered correctly, regardless of if they are run in mschart or ggplot2. 


# orderlabel 0.2.3
## Breaking changes
* `topline()` function name changed to `order_topline()` because the y2_municipal package has a function called topline now.  Shouldn't be a problem because I bet no one used this function anyway. The developers didn't even use it ;)

## Bugs
* New error kept occuring when trying to use the `topbox` argument in `order_label`, but that error is now fixed!


# orderlabel 0.2.2
## Bugs
* All examples now working
* Fixed strange error showing up in some cases: "length of condition > 1"
* Eliminated notes about missing global variables


# orderlabel 0.2.1
## Breaking changes
* `order_label`
1. `label_secific` and `group_specific` are replaced with `label_first` and `group_first`. Naming conventions changed due to the additions of `label_last` and `group_last`.

## New arguments
* `order_label`
1. New arguments: `label_last` and `group_last`. You can use these arguments to choose a specific label or group level you want to show up last on the chart



# orderlabel 0.1.6

## New files
* NEWS.md
* README.md
* cran-comments.md

## Old functions
* `none_other` argument  of `order_label` now applies to group_var, not just label
* Solidified T and F to TRUE and FALSE (should help with minor bugs)
* Eliminated lots of function notes: missing "global variables" and "global functions"
* Updated examples and documentation


# orderlabel 0.1.5

## Old functions
* `other_rm` 
    - Now works on "variable" and "group_var" (in addition to "label")
    - "remove" argument added
* `read_excel_allsheets` 
    - Has option to create one or multiple data frames with var to indicate sheet names
* `order_same`
    - User may specify the grouping variable
* `taking_names`
    - Now creates a tibble
* `order_label`
    - num_fmt argument added
* General updates:
    - Reprex examples for functions
    
## New functions
- `preamble_rm` Have you ever gotten the freqs for matrix questions or multiple choice questions and you get stuck with long question wording attached to the prompt like "What is your favorite color - Blue"? And all you want is "Blue"? Well then this is the function for you! It automatically removes that pesky question wording.
- `add_regions` Creates a census_region variable based off a state variable you give it.
- `add_ages` Give it a year born variable or an age variable (these can still be in the original Qualtrics, factor labelled form), and it will create three new variables for you 1. year_born_numeric, 2. age_numeric, and 3. census_age_groups (using the census age groups we set for our municipal surveys)
